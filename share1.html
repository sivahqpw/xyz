    <h1>SharePlan Prompt</h1>
    <pre id="promptText">I have just learnt this new thing: [insert what you have learnt, e.g., "a great technique of doing classwork using ChatGPT"].

I want you to create a complete content plan for sharing this new learning across all the platforms I use:

1. Free Blog (good SEO, deep value — attracts strangers on Google too)
2. Subscriber Blog (deeper pieces, how-tos, unique frameworks — reward loyal followers)
3. Ebooks (both free and paid)
4. Social Media (Facebook, other platforms)
5. WhatsApp (broadcasts, groups)
6. Facebook Groups (not just Page posts — real engagement)

**Remember:**
How to Test What’s Free vs Paid vs Subscriber:
- Social = snack → always free but high perceived value.
- Free blog = healthy meal → enough depth to help but leaves them wanting the special recipes.
- Subscriber blog = gourmet → my unique secrets, frameworks, guides.
- Ebook = takeaway meal → they pay for the full recipe & cooking instructions.
- Paid ebook = big takeaway meal + bonus chef tips.

**Key Point:**
Social is not just an announcement board. Treat it as a mini delivery platform for real value — like tiny blog posts that link to my bigger ones.

✅ How This Looks in Practice (use this logic in the plan):
- Free Blog: Good SEO, deep value.
- Subscriber Blog: Deeper pieces, how-tos, unique frameworks.
- Free ebook: Short, powerful, easy to share — lead magnet delivered via WhatsApp if needed.
- Paid ebook: Bigger, more detailed, practical toolkit.
- Social Media: Short videos, carousel posts, reels, memes — real value that gives a taste and links to the full content.
  Example: If my blog is “How to Manage Money with 30% Income” → my FB post can share one golden rule from it with a story → then link to full blog.
- WhatsApp: Direct shares, broadcast or groups — push links to loyal readers, e.g., “Hey! New post out. Here’s why you’ll love it…”
- Promotion Without Email: WhatsApp direct share, Facebook Groups engagement, consistent posting, maybe tiny ads.

**Now, using all this, create for me:**
- A clear plan for what to share for free, what to share for subscribers only, what to put in free and paid ebooks.
- Exact content suggestions for each platform: Blog (free), Blog (subscriber), Social Media (Facebook), WhatsApp, Facebook Groups.
- 3 examples of what my Social Media posts can look like for this topic.
- WhatsApp message sample I can copy.
- Anything else I should keep in mind.

Format the answer clearly with bullet points for each platform.</pre>
